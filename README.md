# Tournament Tracker
Tournament Tracker is a web and Windows desktop application that allows users to create and play through tournaments. 
Users can create teams, team members, prizes and score tournaments. The tournament automatically randomizes games and handles an odd number of teams in a tournmanet 
by incorporating bye weeks. Team members are notified via email and text message about their next opponent and of the tournament's winner. 

Additionally, to simulate a real-world business application, the application has the functionality to save data to a SQL database or a text file.
